//16-Bit Full Adder, in dataflow modeling

/*In this full-adder, the Carry in (Cin) is added to A + B directly, then that value is assigned to an internal 17-bit wire, 
with the MSB being assigned to Carry Out (Cout) and bit 15-0 being assigned to the sum output (sum)*/

module FADD (A, B, sum, Cin, Cout);
//Port Declaration
input [15:0] A, B; //operands input
input Cin; //carry in port
output Cout; //carry out port
output [15:0] sum; //summation output 
wire [16:0] IntraSum; //internal value to hold sum of A + B, with pin 16 being the Carry Out in this module
assign IntraSum = A + B + Cin; //add A + B + Cin to InraSum, a 16 bit wire
assign Cout = IntraSum [16]; // output bit 16 of IntraSum as Carry Out
assign sum = IntraSum [15:0]; //output bits 15 through 0 as the sum

endmodule
