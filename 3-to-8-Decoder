//16-Bit Full Adder, in dataflow modeling

/*The following is dataflow design modeling of a 3 to 8 decoder, using powers of 2. */

module Threeto8Decoder (A, D);
//Port Declaration
input [2:0] A; //set input A as 3-bit bus wire
output [7:0] D; //set output D as 8-bit bus wire
assign D = 2**A; //assign the value 2^A to D, i.e. if A is 3, D is 8.  

endmodule
